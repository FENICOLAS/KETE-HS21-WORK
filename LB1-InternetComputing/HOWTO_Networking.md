##### Last update: 27/9/21 dbe

## Background
A world of possibilities is opened to us through the internet and it can be accessed by connecting our devices to it. Without storing the information on the device permanently, we can access the information whenever necessary. The communication with others has become easier and it allows us to organize projects and work together. Networks are formed through the connected device and they run our lives. But such connections also leave our system vulnerable to damage and theft of information is possible. This problem can be solved using cybersecurity and network security and hence it is necessary to understand basic concepts of network security.
