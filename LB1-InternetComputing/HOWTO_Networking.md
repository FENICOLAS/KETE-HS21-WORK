## HOWTO Networking - Some Examples
##### Last update: 27/9/21 dbe

## Background
A world of possibilities is opened to us through the internet and it can be accessed by connecting our devices to it. Without storing the information on the device permanently, we can access the information whenever necessary. The communication with others has become easier and it allows us to organize projects and work together. Networks are formed through the connected device and they run our lives. But such connections also leave our system vulnerable to damage and theft of information is possible. This problem can be solved using cybersecurity and network security and hence it is necessary to understand basic concepts of network security.

## Networking Commands 
The operating system consists of various built-in, command-line networking utilities that are used for network troubleshooting. You will find various networking commands examples which are most essentials for a network administrator.

### Some Networking Command Examples
* **Ping**  
Ping is used to testing a network host capacity to interact with another host. Just enter the command Ping, followed by the target host’s name or IP address. The ping utilities seem to be the most common network tool. This is performed by using the Internet Control Message Protocol, which allows the echo packet to be sent to the destination host and a listening mechanism. If the destination host reply to the requesting host, that means the host is reachable. This utility usually gives a basic image of where there may be a specific networking issue.

ping google.ch
```  

* **NetStat**  
Netstat is a Common TCP – IP networking command-line method present in most Windows, Linux, UNIX, and other operating systems. The netstat provides the statistics and information in the use of the current TCP-IP Connection network about the protocol.  
```
netstat  
netstat -o
netstat -e
netstat -s
```  

* **IPconfig**  
The command IP config will display basic details about the device’s IP address configuration. Just type IP config in the Windows prompt and the IP, subnet mask and default gateway that the current device will be presented. If you have to see full information, then type on command prompt *ipconfig /all* and then you will see full information.  
```
ipconfig  
ipconfig /all
```  

* **Hostname**  
To communicate with each and other, the computer needs a unique address. A hostname can be alphabetic or alphanumeric and contain specific symbols used specifically to define a specific node or device in the network.  
```
hostname
```  

* **Tracert**  
The tracert command is a Command Prompt command which is used to get the network packet being sent and received and the number of hops required for that packet to reach to target. This command can also be referred to as a *traceroute*. It provides several details about the path that a packet takes from the source to the specified destination.  
```

tracert sbb.ch
```  

* **Nslookup**    
The Nslookup, which stands for name server lookup command, is a network utility command used to obtain information about internet servers. It provides name server information for the DNS (Domain Name System), i.e. the default DNS server’s name and IP Address.  
```

### Other Ways of (Inter)Networking Exploration
What is my IP? It’s an odd question in most people’s minds, yet it’s one of the top ten most-searched questions on Google.  Our digital world is similar, and has an address system that allows network traffic to move around the internet. So, an IP (internet protocol) address — which also has its own implicit structure — is fundamentally a numeric address for an endpoint on the internet.

IP geolocation is the science of determining the physical location and Internet connection characteristics of a web visitor. Much like how a street address identifies where you live, an IP address functions as the identifying "street address" of the device and allows companies to see where the device is located and route traffic to the nearest server for faster connections and lower latency.
