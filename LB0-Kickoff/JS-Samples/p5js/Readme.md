# CODE: Simple p5JS Example

##### last update 6.10.2021/dbe

p5.js is a JavaScript library for **creative coding**, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is *free* and *open-source*. Using the metaphor of **a sketch**, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.
