# CODE: Simple p5JS Example

##### last update 6.10.2021/dbe

p5.js is a JavaScript library for **creative coding**, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is *free* and *open-source*. Using the metaphor of **a sketch**, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you’re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.
