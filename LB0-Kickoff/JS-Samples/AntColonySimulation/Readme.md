# CODE: Ant Colony Simulation

##### last update 5.10.2021/dbe

This sketch implements a version of an [Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms).  

In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.[2] Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and **internet routing**. Note: **Routing** is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks

* Ants start out at their nest and leave behind pheromones as they travel around the grid.  
* When any ant finds food, it uses those pheromones to travel back to the nest, and it leaves behind new pheromones so other ants can find the food.
